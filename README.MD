# WooCommerce Free Sample

[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/35a97946d4a9413d98e271ebf634824c)](https://www.codacy.com/app/kevdotbadger/woocommerce-request-sample-product?utm_source=github.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=kevinruscoe/woocommerce-request-sample-product&amp;utm_campaign=Badge_Grade)

## What is this?

Simply put, it adds the ability to add a "sample product" to the cart, that is free.

It adds a button after the "add to cart" button that adds a sample version of the product you're buying.

How does it work?

- Upon activation a "sample product" is created and hidden from the UI.
- When a sample is added to the cart, it adds this "sample product" and updates it's name, image to match the base product.

Products:

- Have an option to toggle if a sample is available (under advanced)

Anything else?

- Upon deactivated the plugin, it'll remove the "sample product".
