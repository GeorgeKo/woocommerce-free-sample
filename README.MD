# What is this?

Basically, it adds a button after the "add to cart" button that:

- Creates a (temporary) sample product, based on the current product
- Adds it to the cart
- Hides it from the admin-grid (to prevent noise)

Products:

- Have an option to toggle if a sample is available

You can also:

- Allow free samples upto an amount (i.e. you're allowed 5 samples for free)
- Set a flat-rate fee for none-free samples (i.e. It's Â£5 for more than 5 samples)

Another few things:

- If a customer removes/sets quantity to zero, it'll delete the sample from WordPress.
- If an order is marked as "complete" or "cancelled", it'll also delete the samples from WordPress.
- If a customer adds the same sample twice, they'll be told they're an idiot.
